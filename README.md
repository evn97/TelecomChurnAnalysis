# TelecomChurnAnalysis
**About this Dataset:**
This data source (Telco Customer Churn) provides information about a companies customers and their churn (cancelation of service). It includes various potentially identifying factors (such as age, gender, etc...) and use produt & service use data (call frequency, minutes, payment method, etc...).

The dataset includes 7043 examples and 21 factors, which applied machine learning and data analysis can be used to create a prediction of churn. This is not only beneficial to understanding factors that might increase a customers potential churn risk, but also to develop methods to prevent churn. This concept is applicable to a wide variety of industry as it could result in increased customer retention, increased revenue for a company and potentially customer satisfaction metrics.

**Executive Summary**:
Identifying a customers risk of churn is paramount for any business since it enables proactive measures to retain clients and profit. Churn, the rate at which customers discontinue their association with with a company, poses a substantial threat to revenue and market stability. By developing extensive and unique analytical tools accompanied with customer relationship management processes a business can identify early signs of dissatisfaction and deploy apt intervention. Reichheld and Schefter (2000) identified this process whereby customer retention heavily influences long-term profitability and emphasized the financial impact of preventing churn. Moreover, the cost for acquisitioning new customers exceeds that of retaining existing ones (Blattberg et al, 2001). Keeping with the theme of Telecommunication, often customer fees such as: equipment, postage & packaging, line installation or "takeover" fees and administrative charges are generated when acquiring a new customer. Not to mention product incentives that can include gifts, vouchers for the customer at the cost of the business. It is already clear that understanding churn  contributes to financial stability, but by employing unique approaches to customers at risk of churn a business fosters a sense of brand loyalty and allows for them to fortify their market position and remain competitive within the market space.

**Data Processing**
WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv was imported into a commonly available database system, google docs.

The above .csv was then formatted into a brief table to spot for incosnsitencies and to explore the scope of the dataset.

As the dataset contained 7043 rows of data, each collumn had to be searched for "null value" or blanks as to understand whether errors could occur when performing trend analysis.

During this process, 11 rows were found to be incomplete data sets as "Total Charges" did not return values for customers whos tenure was <1. This is due to Total Charge being = to monthly charge **x** tenure. These results were then ommited from the set as Churn always resulted in No as they were considered "new customers", as the focus of this work is focused on exploring the relationship churn with existing or loyal customers (tenure â‰¥ 1). Leading to the total remaining examples being 7032.

The results were then aggrigated into understand the range of customer tenure using whatifs formulas as max value for tenure is 72 months, then plotted as a graph to understand how proportunate tenure was.

Then to understand the average tenure of a customer who had churned vs a non-churned customer the following formulas were implemented:
=AVERAGEIF('WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!U2:U7033,"=Yes",'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!F2:F7033)
=AVERAGEIF('WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!U2:U7033,"=No",'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!F2:F7033)
This resulted in an average of 17.97 tenure for a churned customer vs an average of 37.65 for non-churned customer.

Then to understand the average customer charges vs churn label the previous approach was implemented and adapted using the following formula:
=AVERAGEIF('WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!U2:U7033,"=Yes",'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!S2:S7033)
=AVERAGEIF('WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!U2:U7033,"=No",'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!S2:S7033)
This resulted in an average of 74.44 monthly charge for a churned customer vs an average of 61.27 for a non-churned customer.

Then to understand the average total charges vs churn label: 
=AVERAGEIF('WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!U2:U7033,"=Yes",'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!T2:T7033)
=AVERAGEIF('WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!U2:U7033,"=No",'WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn'!T2:T7033)
This resulted in an average of 1531.80 Total charge for a churned customer vs an average of 2555.34 for a non-churned customer.

**Results Interpretation**

From the above analysis the following conclusions can be drawn from the dataset:

1. **Tenure**:
   The dataset indicated that customers who have been with the company longer are less likely to churn, as shown by the lower average tenure for churned customers.
2. **Monthly Charges**
   The dataset indicates that customers who have a higher monthly charge are more likely to churn.
3. **Total Charges**
   The data indicates that customers who've accumulated a higher total charge are less likely to churn.
